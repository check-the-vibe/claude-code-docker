## 2024-12-06 - Open Source Project Setup

### Completed Tasks:
1. **Dockerfile Best Practices**: Updated Dockerfile to use Node.js 22, proper security practices (non-root user), and optimized layer caching
2. **Documentation**: Created comprehensive README.md with usage examples, security considerations, and proper attribution to Anthropic
3. **Contribution Setup**: Added CONTRIBUTING.md with clear guidelines for contributors
4. **Licensing**: Added MIT License with proper attribution to Anthropic for the original Claude Code CLI
5. **Git Configuration**: Created proper .gitignore and .dockerignore files for development
6. **GitHub Templates**: Added issue templates for bug reports, feature requests, and questions

### Project Status:
The project is now ready for open source contributions with:
- Proper Docker best practices implemented
- Complete documentation for users and contributors  
- Clear attribution to Anthropic and Claude Code CLI
- GitHub issue templates for community engagement
- MIT licensing with appropriate disclaimers

### Key Files Created/Updated:
- Dockerfile (security & best practices)
- README.md (comprehensive documentation)
- CONTRIBUTING.md (contributor guidelines)
- LICENSE (MIT with attribution)
- .gitignore (development files)
- .dockerignore (build optimization)
- .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/* (bug, feature, question templates)

## 2024-12-06 - Docker Build Error Fix

### Issue Resolved:
**Problem**: Docker build was failing with npm permission error (EACCES) when trying to install @anthropic-ai/claude-code as non-root user.

**Root Cause**: The Dockerfile was switching to the `claude-user` before installing npm packages globally, but global npm installations require root permissions to write to `/usr/local/lib/node_modules/`.

**Solution**: Reordered Dockerfile steps to:
1. Install Claude Code CLI globally as root first
2. Then create and switch to non-root user
3. Maintain security by running the actual container as non-root

### Verification:
- Docker build now completes successfully ✅
- Claude CLI command available and functional ✅
- Container still runs as non-root user for security ✅

The project successfully wraps the Claude Code CLI in a Docker container while maintaining proper attribution and providing a contribution-ready open source structure.
